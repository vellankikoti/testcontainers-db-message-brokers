# Example 14: Security Testing

This example demonstrates how to perform security testing on a Kafka-based application. It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that the application adheres to security best practices. The example covers:

- Testing for common security vulnerabilities.
- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Verifying data encryption in transit and at rest.

## Features

### Security Vulnerability Testing

- Use tools like `bandit` or `safety` to scan the application for common security vulnerabilities.
- Identify potential issues such as hardcoded secrets, insecure dependencies, and more.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to secure access to the application.
- Verify that only authorized users can access sensitive operations.

### Data Encryption

- Ensure that data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL.
- Verify that sensitive data is stored securely, using encryption at rest where applicable.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

For Kafka:
```bash
pip install kafka-python
```

or
```bash
pip3 install kafka-python
```

For Security Testing:
```bash
pip install bandit safety
```

or
```bash
pip3 install bandit safety
```

### 2. Run Security Vulnerability Scans

Execute the following commands to scan for vulnerabilities:
```bash
bandit -r your_application_directory
```

```bash
safety check
```

### 3. Run the Security Test

Execute the security test file using pytest:

For Kafka:
```bash
python -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```

or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```

### Expected Output

When you run the tests, you should see output similar to the following:
