# Example 09: Data Migration Testing

This example demonstrates how to test data migration processes using Kafka as the message broker. It focuses on ensuring that data is correctly migrated from one system to another while maintaining integrity and consistency. The example covers:

- Sending messages to Kafka to simulate data migration.
- Verifying the integrity of the migrated data.
- Handling potential migration errors.

## Features

### Data Migration Simulation

- Send messages to the Kafka topic to simulate the migration of data from the source system.
- Ensure that all relevant data is captured and sent correctly.

### Data Integrity Verification

- Verify that the data received in the target system matches the original data.
- Implement checks to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Error Handling

- Handle errors that may occur during the migration process.
- Log any discrepancies or issues encountered during the migration.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

For Kafka:
```bash
pip install kafka-python
```

or
```bash
pip3 install kafka-python
```

### 2. Run the Data Migration Test

Execute the data migration test file using pytest:

For Kafka:
```bash
python -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```

or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```

### Expected Output

When you run the test, you should see output similar to the following:
