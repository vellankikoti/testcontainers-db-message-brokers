# Example 09: Data Migration Testing

This example demonstrates how to test data migration processes using a message broker, focusing on ensuring data integrity and successful migration. The example covers:

- Sending messages to initiate data migration.
- Validating the integrity of migrated data.
- Handling errors during the migration process.

---

## Features

### Data Migration Initiation

- Send a message to the message broker to start the data migration process.
- Confirm successful initiation through response messages.

### Data Integrity Validation

- Validate that the data has been migrated correctly.
- Ensure that no data is lost or corrupted during the migration.

### Error Handling

- Handle errors that may occur during the data migration process.
- Send appropriate error messages back to the client.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

For RabbitMQ:
```bash
pip install pika
```

```bash
pip3 install pika
```

For Kafka:
```bash
pip install kafka-python
```
or
```bash
pip3 install kafka-python
```

For Redis:
```bash
pip install redis
```
or
```bash
pip3 install redis
```

### 2. Run the Data Migration Test

Execute the test file using pytest:
```bash
python -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```
or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```
