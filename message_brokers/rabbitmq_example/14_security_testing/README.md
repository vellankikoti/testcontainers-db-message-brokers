# Example 14: Security Testing

This example demonstrates how to perform security testing in a message broker environment, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of message transmission. The example covers:

- Implementing security measures for message brokers.
- Testing for common vulnerabilities.
- Validating secure communication between services.

---

## Features

### Security Measures Implementation

- Configure the message broker with security best practices (e.g., authentication, authorization, encryption).
- Use TLS/SSL for secure communication between services.

### Vulnerability Testing

- Test for common vulnerabilities such as message interception, unauthorized access, and denial of service.
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP or custom scripts to simulate attacks.

### Secure Communication Validation

- Validate that messages are transmitted securely and are not susceptible to tampering.
- Ensure that only authorized services can send and receive messages.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

For RabbitMQ:
```bash
pip install pika
```
or
```bash
pip3 install pika
```

For Kafka:
```bash
pip install kafka-python
```
or
```bash
pip3 install kafka-python
```

For Redis:
```bash
pip install redis
```
or
```bash
pip3 install redis
```

---

### 2. Run the Security Testing

Execute the test file using pytest:
```bash
python -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```
or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```
