# Example 09: Data Migration Testing

This example demonstrates how to test data migration processes using Redis as the data store. It focuses on ensuring that data is correctly migrated from one system to another without loss or corruption. The example covers:

- Migrating data from a legacy system to Redis.
- Validating the integrity of the migrated data.
- Handling errors during the migration process.

## Features

### Data Migration

- Migrate data from a specified source to Redis.
- Validate that all records are correctly migrated and accessible.

### Error Handling

- Handle errors during the migration process.
- Provide appropriate error messages for failed migrations or data integrity issues.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

For Redis:
```bash
pip install redis
```

or
```bash
pip3 install redis
```

### 2. Run the Data Migration Tests

Execute the test file using pytest:

For Redis:
```bash
python -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```

or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 09_data_migration_testing.py -v -s
```

### Expected Output

When you run the test, you should see output similar to the following:
