# Example 14: Security Testing

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to implement security testing for your application using `pytest`. The tests focus on identifying common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass attempts.

---

## Features

### **SQL Injection Testing**
- Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities in login forms.
- Validates input sanitization.
- Ensures proper query parameterization.

### **XSS Protection Testing**
- Tests for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
- Validates HTML escaping.
- Checks content security policies.

### **Authentication Testing**
- Tests for authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
- Validates token-based authentication.
- Ensures proper access control.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pytest`
- `requests` library

---

## Installation
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pytest requests flask
```
or
```bash
pip3 install pytest requests flask
```
---

## Running the Tests
Execute the tests using `pytest`:
```bash
python -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```
or
```bash
python3 -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```

## Key Security Concepts

### **SQL Injection Prevention**
- Use parameterized queries.
- Validate and sanitize input.
- Implement proper error handling.

### **XSS Prevention**
- Escape user input.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Use secure HTTP headers.

### **Authentication Security**
- Implement proper token validation.
- Use secure session management.
- Apply rate limiting.

---

## Best Practices

### **Regular Testing**
- Run security tests as part of CI/CD pipeline.
- Perform periodic security audits.
- Keep security dependencies updated.

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Test all input fields.
- Include edge cases.
- Test both positive and negative scenarios.

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Log security test results.
- Monitor for suspicious patterns.
- Set up alerts for security violations.

---

## Common Use Cases

### **Web Applications**
- Testing login forms.
- Validating API endpoints.
- Checking file upload security.

### **API Security**
- Testing authentication endpoints.
- Validating authorization rules.
- Checking API rate limiting.

### **Database Security**
- Testing input validation.
- Checking access controls.
- Validating data encryption.

---

## Future Enhancements

### **Additional Security Tests**
- CSRF protection testing.
- Session management testing.
- Password policy validation.

### **Advanced Features**
- Automated vulnerability scanning.
- Security report generation.
- Integration with security tools.

### **Performance Improvements**
- Parallel test execution.
- Optimized test scenarios.
- Enhanced error reporting.
