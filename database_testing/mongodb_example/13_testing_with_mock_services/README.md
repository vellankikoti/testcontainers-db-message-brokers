# Example 13: Testing with Mock Services

This example demonstrates how to test interactions with external services using mock services. Mock services simulate the behavior of real external services, allowing you to test your system's functionality without relying on actual third-party APIs. This example covers:

- Simulating external service behavior.
- Testing successful and failed interactions with a mock service.
- Validating error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Ensuring proper integration with external services.

---

## Features

### Mock Service Simulation

- Simulate the behavior of external services.
- Test both successful and failed responses.
- Avoid dependency on real third-party APIs.

### Error Handling

- Validate error handling for failed service interactions.
- Test retry mechanisms for transient failures.

### Integration Testing

- Ensure proper integration with external services.
- Test the system's ability to handle various service responses.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

```bash
pip install pytest requests requests-mock
```

or

```bash
pip3 install pytest requests requests-mock
```

### 2. Run the Test

Execute the test file using `pytest`:

```bash
python -m pytest 13_testing_with_mock_services.py -v -s
```

or

```bash
python3 -m pytest 13_testing_with_mock_services.py -v -s
```

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Mock Service Setup

The test uses the `requests-mock` library to simulate the behavior of an external payment service:

- **Successful Response**: Simulates a successful payment response with a 200 status code.
- **Failed Response**: Simulates a failed payment response with a 400 status code.

### 2. Payment Processing

The system interacts with the mock payment service to:

- Process payments for hotel bookings.
- Handle both successful and failed payment scenarios.

### 3. Error Handling

The test validates the system's ability to:

- Handle failed payment responses gracefully.
- Retry the payment process for transient errors.

- Simulate external service behavior for testing.
- Avoid dependency on real third-party APIs.
- Test both successful and failed interactions.

### Error Handling

- Validate error handling for failed service interactions.
- Test retry mechanisms for transient failures.

### Integration Testing

- Ensure proper integration with external services.
- Test the system's ability to handle various service responses.
