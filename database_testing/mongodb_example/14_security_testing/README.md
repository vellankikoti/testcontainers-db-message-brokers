# Example 14: Security Testing

This example demonstrates how to test the security of a system, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring robust protection against common security threats. The example covers:

- Testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Validating password hashing and verification.
- Implementing and testing rate limiting.
- Ensuring input validation and sanitization.
- Testing session management and account lockout mechanisms.

---

## Features

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries.
- Validate the use of parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.

### Password Security

- Test password hashing and verification mechanisms.
- Ensure secure storage of user credentials using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.

### Rate Limiting

- Test rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Validate error messages and lockout behavior after exceeding the allowed number of attempts.

### Input Validation

- Test input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input.
- Ensure proper handling of invalid or unexpected input.

### Session Management

- Test session creation, expiration, and invalidation.
- Validate secure session handling to prevent session hijacking.

### Account Lockout

- Test account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
- Ensure proper error messages and lockout duration.

## How to Run the Test

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` or `pip3`:

```bash
pip install pytest bcrypt
```

or

```bash
pip3 install pytest bcrypt
```

### 2. Run the Test

Execute the test file using `pytest`:

```bash
python -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```

or

```bash
python3 -m pytest 14_security_testing.py -v -s
```

## Expected Output

When you run the test, you should see output similar to the following:

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention

Tests ensure that all database queries use parameterized statements. The test simulates malicious input to verify that the system is not vulnerable to SQL injection.

### 2. Password Hashing

Uses `bcrypt` to hash and verify passwords. Tests ensure that plaintext passwords are never stored in the database.

### 3. Rate Limiting

Simulates multiple failed login attempts to test rate-limiting mechanisms. The test validates error messages and lockout behavior after exceeding the allowed number of attempts.

### 4. Input Validation

Tests input validation and sanitization for all user inputs. Ensures that invalid or malicious input is handled gracefully.

### 5. Account Lockout

Simulates multiple failed login attempts to test account lockout mechanisms. The test validates that locked accounts cannot be accessed until the lockout period expires.

## Key Takeaways

### Security Best Practices

- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Hash passwords using secure algorithms like bcrypt.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use secure session management practices.

### Testing Practices

- Simulate real-world attack scenarios.
- Validate error handling and logging for security events.
- Test edge cases and unexpected input.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

- Ensure all queries use parameterized statements.
- Test with various malicious inputs to identify vulnerabilities.

### 2. Weak Password Security

- Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- Never store plaintext passwords in the database.

### 3. Rate Limiting Failures

- Test rate-limiting mechanisms for all endpoints.
- Ensure proper error messages and lockout behavior.

### 4. Input Validation Gaps

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Test with unexpected or malicious input to identify gaps.

### 5. Account Lockout Issues

- Ensure accounts are locked after multiple failed attempts.
- Test lockout duration and error messages.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Add testing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Implement and test for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- Add testing for secure cookie handling.

### Testing Improvements

- Simulate more complex attack scenarios.
- Test with larger datasets and concurrent users.
- Integrate with security scanning tools for automated testing.
