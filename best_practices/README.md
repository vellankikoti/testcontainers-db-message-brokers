## ✅ Best Practices Overview

### 🧼 1. Clean Tests ([clean_tests.md](clean_tests.md))
- Ensure **test isolation** to prevent state leakage.
- Use **meaningful test names** and structure (Arrange-Act-Assert pattern).
- Implement **proper teardown** to stop and remove containers after tests.
- Avoid **hardcoded values** by using configuration files or environment variables.

### 🚀 2. Optimizing Startup ([optimizing_startup.md](optimizing_startup.md))
- Use **prebuilt container images** to avoid unnecessary downloads.
- **Reuse test fixtures** to avoid repeated container initialization.
- Enable **parallel test execution** to leverage multi-core processors.
- Optimize **container health checks** to reduce unnecessary delays.

### 🛠️ 3. Resource Management ([resource_management.md](resource_management.md))
- **Limit memory and CPU usage** to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Use **lightweight container images** to reduce system overhead.
- Implement **connection pooling** for databases and message brokers.
- Optimize **CI/CD resource constraints** to ensure efficient test execution.
- Use **cached dependencies** in CI pipelines to reduce redundant installations.

## 🚀 Conclusion
By following these best practices, you can significantly **improve test execution speed, enhance system performance, and maintain test reliability** when using Testcontainers. These guidelines will help ensure **efficient and scalable testing workflows** in development and CI/CD environments.
